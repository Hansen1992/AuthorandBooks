Watch app [here.](https://hansen1992.github.io/AuthorsAndBooks/)

A project I created to practice fething and handling API's in Reactjs.

The app is fetching data using Axios. The data is coming from the Penguin Random House API. 

I have used Semantic UI to style the project a bit to make it look better when displayed, but the main purpose wih the app has been practicing programming in React, so bare with the minimal CSS and general styling.
